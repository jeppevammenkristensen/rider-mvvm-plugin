This a plugin to help with some MVVM tasks. This is a "learn plugin" development project. So I can't guarantee that there won't be annoying bugs in the start of this. I do though do everything to keep them at a minimum. :) 

Current overview:

## Context Actions

### Create Viewmodel

From a view (for instance a Window or Page etc.) a context action is available that will create a viewmodel and set it in the attributes of the view. For instance in an Avalonia project in a view called Somewindow.xaml a viewmodel names SomeWindowViewModel would be created and referenced through the DataType attribute
